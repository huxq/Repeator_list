# Repeator_list
A small python script to filter out all the repeators listed on BCARCC:
https://bcarcc.org/frequency_list

And generate a csv file for importing by anytone 878uv

The anytone878.csv file can be used directly to import to anytone 878uv

The in.txt is copy pasted to a text file from the BCARCC web

The out.CSV is read from the radio just to get a format
